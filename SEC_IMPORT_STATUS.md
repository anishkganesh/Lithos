3. Next phase: Parse PDF/HTML content to extract technical data
4. Link to existing projects with confidence scores
5. Update project data with SEC-sourced information

## 📝 Database Tables

- **Main Table**: `sec_technical_reports`
- **Tracking Table**: `sec_import_runs`
- **Run ID**: eef61eaf-6de7-4f97-a5d4-4a276d685f83

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
