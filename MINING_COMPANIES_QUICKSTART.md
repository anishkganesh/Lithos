# Mining Companies Database - Quick Start Guide

## Overview

This repository now contains a comprehensive database of **120 critical minerals mining companies** ready to populate your Supabase database.

## What's Included

### 1. Data File
**Location:** `/data/mining-companies-comprehensive.json`

- 120 mining companies
- Focus on critical minerals: lithium, copper, nickel, cobalt, rare earths, graphite
- Coverage: ASX, TSX/TSXV, NYSE, NASDAQ, LSE
- Mix of major producers ($100B+ market cap) to junior explorers ($10M+ market cap)

### 2. Population Script
**Location:** `/scripts/populate-mining-companies.ts`

- TypeScript script to load data into Supabase
- Checks for duplicates (skips existing companies by ticker + exchange)
- Provides detailed statistics and reporting
- Safe to run multiple times

### 3. Package Script
Added to `package.json`:
```json
"populate:companies": "tsx scripts/populate-mining-companies.ts"
```

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Verify Database Migration

Ensure the `companies` table exists in your Supabase database:

```bash
npm run migrate:db
```

This should run migration: `/supabase/migrations/006_create_companies_table.sql`

### Step 2: Populate the Database

Run the population script:

```bash
npm run populate:companies
```

**What it does:**
1. Loads 120 companies from the JSON file
2. Checks each company against existing database records
3. Inserts new companies (skips duplicates)
4. Reports statistics by exchange, commodity, market cap

**Expected output:**
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Company Screening
Filter companies by:
- Exchange listing
- Market cap range
- Commodity focus
- Geographic region

### 2. Watchlist Management
The `watchlist` field allows users to:
- Add companies to a personal watchlist
- Track specific companies of interest
- Create custom portfolios

### 3. Market Analysis
Analyze the critical minerals sector:
- Compare market caps across exchanges
- Identify emerging producers
- Track commodity exposure

### 4. Integration with Mining Agent
Use this database as a foundation for:
- News monitoring for specific companies
- Document extraction (Exhibit 96.1 reports)
- Project-level analysis
- Supply chain mapping

## Next Steps

### Enhance the Database

Consider adding additional fields:
```sql
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN production_volume NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN reserves NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN resources NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN primary_commodity TEXT;
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN secondary_commodities TEXT[];
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN project_names TEXT[];
```

### Update Data Regularly

Companies data should be refreshed periodically:
1. Update market caps (monthly)
2. Add new IPOs and listings (quarterly)
3. Update company descriptions and projects (as needed)
4. Remove delisted or acquired companies

### Connect to Other Features

Link companies to:
- News articles (track company mentions)
- SEC filings (Exhibit 96.1 technical reports)
- Projects (company -> projects relationship)
- Chat/AI features (company-specific insights)

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
Ensure `.env.local` contains:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-key
```

### Duplicate Companies
The script checks for duplicates by `ticker` + `exchange`. If you need to re-populate:
1. Clear existing data:
```sql
DELETE FROM companies;
```
2. Re-run the population script

### Missing Dependencies
Ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
npm install
```
